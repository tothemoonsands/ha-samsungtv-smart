        the receive loop never exits, and every request just times out forever
        — the integration stays wedged until a reload (issue #153). Detect it

        don't implement a request) don't trip it: interleaved successful
        requests keep resetting the streak.

        get_thumbnail never answers (2024 Frames), the thumbnail coordinator
